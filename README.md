The Chaos Engine for Minecraft 1.21.1
=======
The Chaos Engine is a future NeoForge technology and exploration mod solely developed by me, ChaosAtom, as my first foray 
into mod making. Everything currently within this rather barebones mod was done by me with very little modding knowledge 
outside some brief experiences over the years. For instance, there is still no actual exploration element, I've been 
scratching my head figuring out everything from the ground up.

Additionally, this mod is entered into CurseForge's "The Future" modjam and more information will be coming later as I 
develop the mod some more, even after the modjam.
